    <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
        It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.
        ... Modern consoles often provide a graphical interface that can be used to control machines on a local network (LAN)
        or provide remote access to remote systems.</p>
